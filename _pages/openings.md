<h3 class="sapienza-text"> Master Theses for Sapienza University students</h3>
If you are a Master student at Sapienza University looking for a Master project, contact me per email ( capobianco AT diag.uniroma1.it) or stop by my office. We are interested mainly on thesis projects about robot learning, knowledge acquisition and learning, reinforcement learning or explainable artificial intelligence, but different topics are welcome!
Here you can find a brief list of available topics for master thesis. These are only a limited set, many others are available and we are also open to your proposals. When you contact us, please identify a macro-topic (RL, XAI, CL+XAI, RL+XAI, NeSy).

Use the HDAC datasets (11 protein groups, with the first being much larger than the others). This application is of great interest in the pharmaceutical field, as the different proteins are used for very different purposes (e.g., weight loss vs. cancer). Therefore, understanding which properties make a molecule active for one protein (the one related to cancer) rather than another (the one related to weight loss) could make it possible to propose modifications to the proteins so that they become active for the desired target.
