  bio: I am a continuous learner looking for new concepts from different fields and domains â€” e.g. AI, psychology, astronomy and neuroscience. My research is focused on improving the interpretability of Deep Learning techniques, such as Recurrent Networks or Memory Augmented Neural Networks. I am deeply interested on the connection between memory, learning process and interpretability from both computational and cognitive perspectives. I have a background in computer science and Artificial Intelligence, having a M. Sc. degree in "Artificial Intelligence and Robotics" and a B. Sc. in "Computer Science", both from the Sapienza University.

  bio: I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Sapienza University of Rome, under the supervision of professors Giuseppe De Giacomo and Roberto Capobianco. I'm interested in Reinforcement Learning, Planning, and Representation Learning. In particular, my research focuses on bridging the gap between neural networks representation and symbolic logical models, to enhance knowledge transfer, generalization and explainability. I'm also a big fan of robotics applications, developed also during my studies in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Sapienza University.
