  bio: I am a continuous learner that loves learning new concepts also from domains and fields different from mine - e.g. psychology, astronomy and neuroscience. My research is focused on improving the interpretability of Deep Learning techniques, such as Recurrent Networks or Memory Augumented Neural Networks. I am deeply interested on the connection between memory, learning process and interpretability from both computational and cognitive perspectives. I have a background in computer science and Artificial Intelligence, having a M. Sc. degree in "Artificial Intelligence and Robotics" and a B. Sc. in "Computer Science", both from the Sapienza University.
