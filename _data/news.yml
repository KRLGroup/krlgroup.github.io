  headline: 'We are happy to announce that our paper "Agent-Based Markov Modeling for Improved COVID-19 Mitigation Policies" has been published in JAIR (Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research). Joint work between Roberto Capobianco,  Varun Raj Kompella, James Ault, Guni Sharon, Stacy Jong, Spencer Fox, Lauren Meyers, Peter Wurman and Peter Stone. In this paper, we study how reinforcement learning and Bayesian inference can be used to optimize mitigation policies that minimize economic impact without overwhelming hospital capacity.
