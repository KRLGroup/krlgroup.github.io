While good Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship models (QSAR) can help predicting molecular properties without the need to synthesize them, it is still required to come up with new molecules to be tested. This is mostly done in lack of tools to determine which modifications are more promising or which aspects of a molecule are more influential for the final activity/property. Here we present an automatic process which involves Graph Convolutional Network models and input-attribution methods to generate new molecules. We also explore the problems of over-optimization and applicability, recognizing them as two important aspects in the practical use of such automatic tools.},<br>

abstract = {Efficient robotic behaviors require robustness and adaptation to dynamic changes of the environment, whose characteristics rapidly vary during robot operation. To generate effective robot action policies, planning and learning techniques have shown the most promising results. However, if considered individually, they present different limitations. Planning techniques lack generalization among similar states and require experts to define behavioral routines at different levels of abstraction. Conversely, learning methods usually require a considerable number of training samples and iterations of the algorithm. To overcome these issues, and to efficiently generate robot behaviors, we introduce LoOP, an iterative learning algorithm for optimistic planning that combines state-of-the-art planning and learning techniques to generate action policies. The main contribution of LoOP is the combination of Monte-Carlo Search Planning and Q-learning, which enables focused exploration during policy refinement in different robotic applications. We demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of LoOP in various domains and multiple robotic platforms, by validating the proposed approach with an extensive experimental evaluation.}<br>

abstract = {Representing unknown and missing knowledge about the environment is fundamental to leverage robot behavior and improve its performance in completing a task. However, reconstructing spatial knowledge beyond the sensory horizon of the robot is an extremely challenging task. Existing approaches assume that the environment static and features repetitive patterns (e.g. rectangular rooms) or that it can be all generalized with pre-trained models. Our goal is to remove such assumptions and to introduce a novel methodology that allows the robot to represent unknown spatial knowledge in dynamic and unstructured environments. To this end, we exploit generative learning to (1) learn a distribution of spatial landmarks observed during the robot mission and to (2) generate missing information in real-time. The proposed approach aims at supporting planning and decision-making processes needed for robot behaviors. In this paper, we describe architecture modeling the proposed approach and a first validation on a mobile platform.},
